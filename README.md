# Dos-Atack (Stress Testing)
## Greetings 👋
Good day dear user, glad you decided to visit this repository, this repository contains a tool that performs stress testing of sites🌐 or servers, it will be up to you. Please keep in mind that I am not responsible for your actions with this script. If the NSC comes to you tomorrow morning, asking you to pay the fine, it is entirely your fault. Do not use this script for bad purposes⛓
## What is Dos-Atack?💣
__*Dos attack*__ is a hacker attack, a type of denial of service. This attack is usually performed for ransom💰 More specifically, the attacker starts attacking the service, then informs the service about the attack and demands an undefined amount of money for stopping the attack on the service🚀 This is of course not the only method of using this script, but we gave you just a common example. Please don't do that, this is not a call to action and just an example for you to get it right ☺
## What would you need it for?
On the bright side, you may need __*Dos-Atack*__ to check if the site is protected from such attacks. And, if necessary, take recommended action 👩‍⚖️ You can also check the source code of this tool and understand how such an attack works, the current tool contains the most primitive type of attack - band saturation or in other words __*HTTP Flood*__ 🎈
## What are the advantages of this tool? 🔰
Let me tell you a little bit about the advantages of my script:
+ Asynchronous requests __*(Gevent + Requests)*__ 🔀
+ Pseudo-multithreading __*(threading library)*__, GIL limitations are to blame ⚔
+ Every request has a randomly generated __*User-Agent*__ 👤
+ Just in use console interface🎱
## How do I install this tool on Windows?
In order to install this script on Windows you need to download Python 🐍, you can download it from [official website](https://www.python.org/). Please install Python version 3.10.0 or later. After installation, download the current repository to your PC, save it to the disk where the operating system is 🖥 Next you need to open the console, on Windows this is done by pressing __*Win + R*__ and inside you need to type in __*cmd*__, then go to the directory where you downloaded and where you unpacked the archive. And the last step is you need to prescribe these commands:
