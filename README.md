# Dos-Atack (Stress Testing)
## Greetings
Greetings dear reader✌ Glad you decided to visit this repository! Let me tell you a little bit about it! In the current repository you can find the file __*main.py*__, which is a script file. This script implements the __(D)Dos-Atack (Stress Testing Sites)__ features. What is __*Dos-Atack*__? __*Dos-Atack*__ is a distributed denial of service attack✔
## What are the differences between this script and the others?
My script differs from the others in that it does not use the __*socket*__ module but uses the __*GRequests*__ asynchronous query library and has a pseudo multithreading (all thanks to GIL, so forgive me if I express myself correctly and not as I would like)
## How can I install and run the script?
In order to use the script you will need [Python🐍](https://www.python.org/). After you install Python, please install the dependencies needed for the script to work properly 💪
